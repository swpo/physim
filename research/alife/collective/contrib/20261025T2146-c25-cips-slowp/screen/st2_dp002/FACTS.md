# Evidence pack: cips-fuel (seed 0)

- world: `../../world.py`, family `catalysis-induced-phase-separation`
- parent: collective/contrib/20261025T1845-c23-cips-metabolic-claim; mutation: c23 CIPS-fuel with a product diffusivity Dp (slow product, fuel-starved cores)
- run: 301 frames x 100 steps x dt 0.1 = time 3000; grid [128, 128]; wall 81s; status ok
- command: `python -m labkit.run /home/user/physim/research/alife/collective/contrib/20261025T2146-c25-cips-slowp/screen/../world.py --out /home/user/physim/research/alife/collective/contrib/20261025T2146-c25-cips-slowp/screen/st2_dp002 --seeds 0 --size 128 128 --frames 300 --no-movie`
- segmentation: matter > 0.86 of robust range [0.0027, 0.5792], min area 6 px

## Measurements
- components: final 0, mean 0.0, max 0; occupancy final 0.00
- tracks: 0; persistent (alive >= 50% of run): 0; longest 0 frames; alive start-to-end: 0
- size of persistent tracks: max/min area ratio 0.00 (1 = constant size)
- enclosures: components with a hole mean 0.00, final 0; holes at thresholds 0.2/0.35/0.5 final [2, 0, 0]
- persistent homology of matter (final frame, tau 0.1/0.25/0.5): H0 [131, 99, 55], H1 [48, 0, 0]
- motion: 0 long-lived tracks moved >= 1 body length; max speed 0/time; max body lengths 0.0
- replication (lineage window K = 20 frames = time 200, default): splits 0, persistent splits 0 (0 more failed only because the siblings re-merged within K), max generation 0, merges 0, merge/split ratio n/a, nucleations 0
- channel total drift (end/start - 1): [0.0, -0.3124, 0.441]
- radial profiles: no component with area >= 12 px at the sampled frames

## Warnings
- no components at the end: matter died out or fell below threshold
