# Evidence pack: cips-turnover (seed 3)

- world: `../../../20261026T0726-c35-cips-coop-inhib-screen/world.py`, family `catalysis-induced-phase-separation`
- parent: collective/contrib/20261025T1845-c23-cips-metabolic-claim; mutation: c23 CIPS on a consumed fuel plus uniform, fuel-independent enzyme turnover d(e0-e) (Zwicker-type made-outside / lost-inside)
- run: 121 frames x 1000 steps x dt 0.1 = time 12000; grid [192, 192]; wall 753s; status ok
- command: `python -m labkit.run collective/contrib/20261026T0726-c35-cips-coop-inhib-screen/world.py --out collective/contrib/c39-rev-cips-wip/inhib_DI01_kI03/seed3 --seeds 3 --size 192 192 --frames 120 --spf 1000 --no-movie`
- segmentation: matter > 9.83 of robust range [0.1156, 0.1547], min area 6 px

## Measurements
- components: final 0, mean 0.0, max 0; occupancy final 0.00
- tracks: 0; persistent (alive >= 50% of run): 0; longest 0 frames; alive start-to-end: 0
- size of persistent tracks: max/min area ratio 0.00 (1 = constant size)
- enclosures: components with a hole mean 0.00, final 0; holes at thresholds 0.2/0.35/0.5 final [0, 0, 0]
- persistent homology of matter (final frame, tau 0.1/0.25/0.5): H0 [1, 1, 1], H1 [0, 0, 0]
- motion: 0 long-lived tracks moved >= 1 body length; max speed 0/time; max body lengths 0.0
- replication (lineage window K = 20 frames = time 2000, default): splits 0, persistent splits 0 (0 more failed only because the siblings re-merged within K), max generation 0, merges 0, merge/split ratio n/a, nucleations 0
- channel total drift (end/start - 1): [-0.0004, -0.8624, 0.9279]
- radial profiles: no component with area >= 12 px at the sampled frames

## Warnings
- no components at the end: matter died out or fell below threshold
- a channel total changed by more than 50% (not conserved; may be fine if the model is open)

Measurements are screens, not verdicts: judge them against the images.
