`ds3_014-intro.mp4` is a presentation excerpt of the historical `ds3_014`
simulation, with the fields combined in one view. It is not a new simulation or
an evaluation rollout. The original research animations, including plots, remain
in `../blobs/p7_world_ds3_014.gif` and `../blobs/p7_world_ds3_014_long.gif`.

The user supplied the source recording on 2026-09-15:
`Screen Recording 2026-08-24 at 11.06.59 AM (1).mov`, SHA-256

The recording is retained locally. The web export removes the title, timestamp,
and border, preserves playback order and speed, and has no audio. Its restart
is an ordinary replay, not a claim of periodic dynamics.

Export with FFmpeg using `crop=418:418:18:29,fps=30`, H.264, `yuv420p`, CRF 19,
the slow preset, `+faststart`, and no metadata. `ds3_014-intro.jpg` is the frame
at five seconds, used as the video's loading poster. These are static media
inputs preserved by `scripts/build_docs.py`.

## BF and XV field snapshots

`bf-sham.png` and `bf-trail-pulse.png` show activator 0 at time 50 from
recorded no-source and five-unit trail-pulse experiments. The source pulse has
amplitude 0.05 on public port 2 and runs from t=0 to t=5. The two displayed
realizations use independent noise (recorded truth seeds 51000 and 51005) and
identical initial fields. Dashed contours mark the initial activator level 0.5;
the pink cross marks the fixed source in both panels.

`xv-0.png`, `xv-125.png`, and `xv-250.png` show the first recorded unforced,
coupled XV continuation at those times (recorded truth seed 53001). The white
contour marks partner activator 1 at level 0.5. All three use the same spatial
window; they do not recenter on the moving structures.

All panels render the original grid values with nearest-neighbor display and
the common activator color scale in `activator-scale.png` (−1 to 1.6). Scale
bars measure five spatial units. These are spatial crops, not full-domain plots.
Exact crop arrays and source hashes live in `docs_source/data/world-visuals.npz`
and its JSON sidecar. Regenerate with `scripts/render_world_visuals.py`;
no simulation or inference is run. The original scientific report and its
figures are unchanged.
