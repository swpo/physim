# Repository organization

The active layout follows [Prime Intellect's residency-environments guidance](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/residency-environments/blob/01d9f5f80572b7ec82575b10d45a800ed844e496/AGENTS.md),
reviewed at commit `01d9f5f80572b7ec82575b10d45a800ed844e496`.

## Blobkit and the eventual upstream PR

Prime has no `packages/` convention. Its `pmpp-hard` environment depends on a
separately released `kernelguard` package, which is the closer precedent for our
simulator. Blobkit belongs in a separately installable library, because it serves
both native environment execution and research/data generation. Physim pins the public Blobkit 0.3.5 wheel URL and SHA-256; the local uv
workspace resolves it from `packages/blobkit/` during development.

Generation and evaluation share Blobkit's simulation implementation. The package
also provides customizable Python metrics/operators, evolutionary search,
scheduling, checkpoints, and harvesting. Concrete recipes call those APIs from
`generators/physim/`. Their source, settings, and execution history are archived
with the worlds in `registry/`; reading the registry does not execute code. The
environment does not import generation APIs or depend on the generator checkout.
Harvested genomes acquire physical world/preparation/suite identities when
prepared and validated for evaluation.

The accepted ownership plan is recorded in
`handoff/architecture/PLAN.md`. Blobkit source and releases remain in this
personal repository. The intended upstream contribution includes the Physim
environment and its portable evaluation-specific generation, preparation and
validation workflows, together with configs and Docker/build support. Evaluation
imports the installed Blobkit simulation API without importing campaign scripts.

The Prime candidate includes the environment, explicit evaluation configs,
Docker/build support, and portable BF/XV preparation and validation workflows.
The preparation downloader follows immutable registry references and fetches only
the selected world's required inputs. Fresh continuation, truth generation,
mechanism controls, and registry round-trip checks use installed packages without
the personal research checkout. Historical search and initialization evidence
remain archived in the registry; the portable recipes start at saved endpoints.
See `handoff/pr_preparation_20260915/REPORT.md` for the current contribution status.

This repository retains Blobkit, exploratory research, and the website. Keep the
local environment copy until Prime accepts the contribution and the research
workspace has been adapted to consume it as an installed dependency; subsequent
shared-environment changes will be maintained in Prime.

Prime asks for actual eval smoke runs and maintains generic package checks. Our
existing scientific regression checks are retained under `scripts/physim/validation/`
for local reproducibility; they are not proposed as new upstream per-env tests.
The generic `tests/test_envs.py` is copied unchanged from the pinned upstream
commit under Apache-2.0. The upstream root workspace, tests, and CI should not be
replaced by this repository's files when making the PR.

## Development and validation

```sh
uv sync --locked
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pytest -n auto tests -v
uv run python scripts/physim/validation/test_blob_round6.py --gates toy native
uv run python scripts/physim/validation/test_blob_round6_eval.py
uv run python scripts/physim/validation/test_blob_round6_explore.py
uv run python -m unittest discover -s scripts/physim/validation -p test_r6_verifiers.py
uv run python -m unittest discover -s scripts/physim/validation -p test_bundles.py
uv run python scripts/build_docs.py
uv run python scripts/check_docs.py
```

Set `PHYSIM_TEST_BUNDLE` to a verified evaluation bundle to enable the additional
bundle/cache/reference tests. Without it, those checks explicitly skip. Native
migration checks also need the original research fixtures. CI runs the
independent checks; [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) covers native and clean-install
validation. The environment README contains the eval CLI smoke command.

The root uses Python 3.12, uv, and Prime's Ruff F/I rules at line length 120.
Four Physim reference files (`blobround6.py`, `blobround6_eval.py`,
`blobround6_explore.py`, `devices.py`) and the historical blobkit implementation
are excluded from formatting: scientific manifests bind their exact source bytes.
Changing their formatting would invalidate those identities. This is an explicit
local exception to discuss in the eventual PR, not a recertification of the law.

## Historical boundaries

The active installable blobkit source is `packages/blobkit/`. The original
`probes/blobs/blobkit/` tree remains as provenance and for old research scripts.
New changes belong in the active package. The old engine, servers, and tasksets
have moved out of the installable environment into `probes/legacy/physim/`.
Only migration helpers explicitly activate those legacy modules. The tiny
`physim/blobdata/` source fixture is retained for old manifest paths and is excluded
from both source and wheel distributions.

The R6 scheduler, scorer, experiment service, and CPU kernels keep their original
bytes. Five device definitions were extracted with identical syntax trees.
`handoff/repo_cleanup/` preserves the earlier cleanup evidence;
`handoff/residency_alignment/` records this reorganization and the pre-move source.
`handoff/blobkit_polish/` records standalone library packaging and CPU/CUDA checks.
Research caches, retained truths, rollouts, and frozen run manifests are preserved.
The installed runtime loads only explicit standalone bundles.

Edit `docs_source/`, then rebuild/check `docs/`. The release staging helper updates
world metadata. Runs and binary products belong in ignored `outputs/` and `dist/`.
Do not stage historical logs, process IDs, caches, or bulk output with source changes.
